# JavaScriptFCCProjects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of projects that I developed as part of FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Certification. Each project showcases my understanding and skills in solving algorithmic challenges and building practical applications. I've leveraged various technologies, including Tailwind CSS for responsive design, traditional CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
